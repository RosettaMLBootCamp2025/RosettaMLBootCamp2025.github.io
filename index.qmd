Welcome to the ML Protein Design Bootcamp 2025! This self-paced course covers machine learning tools for protein structure prediction and design.

## Course Overview

This bootcamp is organized into 4 days of content plus a capstone project. Each day contains sequential modules that build on each other.

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
### [Monday](monday/index.qmd) {.day-card}

**Tool Installation**: Install essential ML protein design tools on your HPC cluster including LocalColabFold, ESMFold, LigandMPNN, RFdiffusion2, Chai-1, Boltz-2, and BindCraft.
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
### [Tuesday](tuesday/index.qmd) {.day-card}

**Structure Prediction**: Learn protein visualization with PyMOL, predict structures with AlphaFold2, and compare prediction methods (ESMFold vs AF2) to understand their trade-offs.
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
### [Wednesday](wednesday/index.qmd) {.day-card}

**Advanced Prediction & Design**: Compare AlphaFold3 and Chai-1 on complex predictions, then design proteins with RFdiffusion including binders and symmetric oligomers.
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
### [Thursday](thursday/index.qmd) {.day-card}

**Docking & Reflection**: Explore CPU vs GPU computing with a hands-on PyTorch activity, learn molecular docking for protein-ligand interactions, and reflect on your learning before starting the capstone project.
:::

::: {.g-col-12}
### [Protein Binder Capstone Project](capstone/index.qmd) {.day-card}

**De Novo Binder Design**: Design a protein binder for a target of your choice using RFdiffusion, LigandMPNN, and structure prediction tools. Choose from therapeutic targets like PD-L1, enzymes like TEM-1 beta-lactamase, or allergens like Bet v 1.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a day** from the navigation above or the cards below
2. **Work through modules** in order - each builds on the previous
3. **Check off sections** as you complete them - your progress is saved automatically
4. **Return anytime** - use the "Resume" button to pick up where you left off
