title: "3. Reflection & Capstone Introduction"

Before diving into the capstone project, take time to reflect on what you've learned and prepare your approach. This self-guided activity helps you consolidate your knowledge and plan your binder design project.

## Part 1: Reflecting on Your Learning

Take 10-15 minutes to think through these questions. Consider writing your answers in a notebook or document—this reflection will help solidify your understanding and identify areas to revisit.

### Structure Prediction

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions
1. **What surprised you most** about how AlphaFold2 or ESMFold work?
2. **When would you choose ESMFold over AlphaFold2?** What are the trade-offs?
3. **How do you interpret pLDDT scores?** What score range makes you confident in a prediction?
4. **What does the PAE matrix tell you** that pLDDT alone doesn't?
:::

### Protein Design

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions
1. **How does RFdiffusion "know" what shape to generate?** What's the role of the noise schedule?
2. **Why do we need sequence design (LigandMPNN) after backbone generation?** Why can't RFdiffusion output sequences directly?
3. **What's the difference between unconditional and conditional generation** in RFdiffusion?
4. **How do hotspot residues guide the design process?**
:::

### Computational Concepts

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions
1. **Why are GPUs faster than CPUs** for these ML tools?
2. **When might CPU actually be faster** than GPU?
3. **What's the benefit of vectorization** in numerical computing?
:::

### Connecting the Tools

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions
1. **Sketch out the typical workflow** for designing a protein binder. What tools do you use at each step?
2. **Where in the pipeline would you use structure prediction?** Where would you use it for validation?
3. **What would you do if your designed binder had low pLDDT** when you predicted its structure?

## Part 2: Introduction to the Capstone Project

The capstone project brings together everything you've learned. You'll design a **de novo protein binder** for a target of your choice.

### What is Binder Design?

Binder design is formulated as: *"Given a target protein (and optionally a specific epitope), design a smaller protein capable of binding the target."*

This is one of the most important problems in computational protein design, with applications in:

- **Therapeutics**: Blocking disease-related protein interactions
- **Diagnostics**: Creating detection reagents
- **Research tools**: Probing protein function
- **Synthetic biology**: Building new biological circuits

### Available Targets

You'll choose from one of these curated targets, each representing a different challenge:

| Category | Targets | Challenge Level |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Immune Checkpoint** | PD-L1, IFNAR2, IL-7Rα | Well-studied interfaces, therapeutic relevance |
| **Allergen** | Bet v 1 | Smaller target, antibody-like design |
| **Enzymes** | TrkA, TEM-1, GM2 Activator, Beta-Glucosidase | Diverse binding sites, varied complexity |

::: {.callout-tip}
## Choosing Your Target
Consider what interests you most:
- **Therapeutic relevance?** → PD-L1, IFNAR2, IL-7Rα
- **Smaller, focused project?** → Bet v 1
- **Enzyme inhibition?** → TEM-1, Beta-Glucosidase
- **Receptor binding?** → TrkA

## Part 3: Planning Your Approach

Before starting the capstone, develop a plan. Answer these questions to guide your work.

### Target Selection

::: {.callout-important}
## Planning Questions
1. **Which target interests you most?** Why?
2. **What PDB structure will you use?** Have you looked at it in PyMOL?
3. **What residues define the binding interface?** (Check the target's detail page)
4. **Are there any potential challenges** with your target (flexible regions, glycosylation sites, etc.)?
:::

### Design Strategy

::: {.callout-important}
## Planning Questions
1. **What size binder will you aim for?** (Typical range: 50-100 residues)
2. **Will you use hotspot conditioning** in RFdiffusion? Which residues?
3. **How many designs will you generate** at each step?
4. **What metrics will you use to filter designs?** (pLDDT, PAE, interface contacts, etc.)
:::

### Documentation Plan

::: {.callout-important}
## Planning Questions
1. **How will you keep track of your experiments?** (Lab notebook, Jupyter notebook, README, etc.)
2. **What format will you use to present your work?** (Report, slides, video, GitHub repo)
3. **What commands and settings will you record?** (Think about reproducibility)

## Part 4: Getting Started Checklist

Before moving to the capstone, make sure you can answer "yes" to these:

- [ ] I've reviewed the tools from Monday and know how to run them
- [ ] I understand the structure prediction outputs (pLDDT, PAE)
- [ ] I know how RFdiffusion and LigandMPNN work together
- [ ] I've chosen a target (or narrowed it down to 2-3 options)
- [ ] I've looked at my target structure in PyMOL
- [ ] I have a plan for documenting my work

::: {.callout-tip}
## Ready to Start?
Head to the [Capstone Project](../capstone/index.qmd) page to begin! Each target has a dedicated page with specific guidance, PDB information, and strategy tips.
