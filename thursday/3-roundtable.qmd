title: "3. Roundtable Discussion"
---

The roundtable discussion is an interactive session where you'll engage with peers and instructors to discuss your learning journey, share insights, and explore the future of ML-driven protein design.

## Purpose

This roundtable provides an opportunity to:

- **Reflect on the week**: What have you learned? What surprised you?
- **Share experiences**: Discuss challenges and breakthroughs with peers
- **Ask questions**: Get instructor insights on topics that interest you
- **Look ahead**: Discuss how these tools might evolve and impact your research

## Discussion Format

The roundtable is structured to encourage open dialogue and knowledge sharing among all participants. Come prepared with questions and observations from your work throughout the bootcamp.

## Preparation
Think about which tools you found most useful, what challenges you encountered, and how you might apply these methods to your own research.

## Topics to Consider

As you prepare for the discussion, consider these themes:

### Technical Reflections

- Which prediction tool (AlphaFold2, ESMFold, etc.) gave the best results for your proteins?
- How did you decide which design tool to use for different applications?
- What surprised you about CPU vs GPU performance?

### Practical Applications

- How might these tools fit into your current research workflow?
- What validation experiments would you need to trust the predictions?
- How do you handle cases where different tools give conflicting predictions?

### Future Directions

- What capabilities are still missing from current tools?
- How might these tools evolve in the next few years?
- What ethical considerations arise from democratized protein design?

## Preparing for the Capstone

The roundtable also serves as a transition to the capstone project. Use this time to:

1. **Discuss your target choice**: Share which capstone target interests you and why
2. **Plan your approach**: Get feedback on your design strategy
3. **Form collaborations**: Find peers with complementary skills or interests
