## Overview

Molecular docking is fundamental to computational drug discovery and protein engineering. It allows you to:

- **Predict binding poses**: Determine how a ligand fits into a protein's binding site
- **Estimate binding affinity**: Score how strongly molecules interact
- **Screen compound libraries**: Rapidly evaluate thousands of potential drug candidates
- **Guide protein design**: Understand what makes a good binding pocket

## Why Docking Matters for ML Protein Design

In the context of this bootcamp, docking connects to several tools you've learned:

| Tool | Docking Application |
|------|---------------------|
| **RFdiffusion** | Design proteins with specific binding pockets |
| **LigandMPNN** | Design sequences that maintain ligand interactions |
| **DiffDock-PP** | ML-based protein-protein docking |
| **PLACER** | Ligand placement in designed pockets |
| **BindCraft** | Binder design with docking validation |

## Key Concepts

### What is Docking?

Docking algorithms search for the optimal orientation and conformation of a ligand within a protein's binding site. This involves:

1. **Sampling**: Exploring different positions, orientations, and conformations
2. **Scoring**: Evaluating each pose using physics-based or empirical functions
3. **Ranking**: Identifying the most likely binding mode

### Types of Docking

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Rigid docking** | Protein and ligand treated as rigid bodies | Fast screening |
| **Flexible ligand** | Ligand conformations explored | Standard docking |
| **Flexible protein** | Both protein and ligand can move | Induced fit modeling |
| **Protein-protein** | Docking two proteins together | Interface prediction |

### Scoring Functions

Docking programs use scoring functions to estimate binding affinity. Common approaches include:

- **Physics-based**: Van der Waals, electrostatics, solvation
- **Empirical**: Trained on experimental binding data
- **Knowledge-based**: Statistical potentials from known structures
- **ML-based**: Neural networks trained on binding data

## Scoring Function Limitations
No scoring function is perfect. Docking is useful for ranking poses and identifying likely binding modes, but absolute binding energy predictions remain challenging.

## Common Docking Software

| Software | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **AutoDock Vina** | Small molecule | Fast, widely used |
| **GNINA** | ML-enhanced | CNN-based scoring |
| **DiffDock** | ML-based | Diffusion model approach |
| **HADDOCK** | Protein-protein | Data-driven docking |
| **ClusPro** | Protein-protein | Web server available |
| **Rosetta** | Both | Part of Rosetta suite |

## Questions to Consider

1. How does the choice of scoring function affect docking results?
2. When would you use rigid vs. flexible docking?
3. How can docking guide your protein design projects in the capstone?
4. What are the limitations of docking for predicting actual binding affinity?
