title: "Thursday: Docking & Discussion"
---

## Overview

Thursday brings together computational concepts with practical applications and collaborative discussion. You'll explore the differences between CPU and GPU computing through hands-on experiments, learn about molecular docking for understanding protein-ligand interactions, and participate in a roundtable discussion to reflect on the bootcamp experience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Thursday, you will be able to:

- Explain why GPUs outperform CPUs for certain computational tasks
- Understand the importance of vectorization in numerical computing
- Describe the principles of molecular docking
- Apply docking concepts to protein design workflows
- Articulate connections between different tools learned throughout the bootcamp

## Modules

| # | Module | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| [1](1-cpu-vs-gpu.qmd) | CPU vs GPU Computing | Hands-on activity comparing computational performance |
| [2](2-docking.qmd) | Molecular Docking | Introduction to predicting molecular interactions |
| [3](3-roundtable.qmd) | Reflection & Capstone Introduction | Self-reflect on your learning and plan your capstone project |

## Schedule

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Morning | CPU vs GPU Activity |
| Mid-day | Docking Lesson |
| Afternoon | Reflection & Capstone Introduction |

## Preparation

- Ensure you have access to Google Colab for the CPU vs GPU activity
- Review any tools or concepts from earlier in the week that you'd like to discuss
- Think about which capstone target interests you most
