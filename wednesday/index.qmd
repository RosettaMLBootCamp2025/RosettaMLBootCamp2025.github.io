## Overview

Wednesday focuses on **advanced structure prediction and protein design**. You'll compare AlphaFold3 and Chai-1 for complex predictions (multimers, ligands, ions), then dive into RFdiffusion for de novo protein design including binder generation and symmetric oligomers.

## Modules

| Module | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [1. AlphaFold3 vs. Chai-1](0-alphafold3.qmd) | Comparing Next-Gen Predictors | Compare AF3 and Chai-1 on monomers, multimers, and protein-ligand complexes |
| [2. RFdiffusion](1-rfdiffusion.qmd) | Advanced Protein Design | Design unconditional monomers, motif scaffolds, binders, and symmetric oligomers using RFdiffusion |
