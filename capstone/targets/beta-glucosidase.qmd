## Biological Context

**Beta-Glucosidase** is an enzyme that breaks down complex sugars (glucosides) into glucose. It is relevant in both human metabolism (Gaucher's disease) and industrial biofuel production.

**Why it matters:** In industrial applications, thermostable or stabilized versions of this enzyme are highly valuable. In health, chaperones (binders) that help fold unstable mutants can be therapeutic.

**The Goal:** Design a binder that stabilizes the enzyme without blocking its active site, or conversely, an inhibitor that blocks it.

## Design Mission

Target a surface patch on Beta-Glucosidase.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | Beta-Glucosidase |
| **PDB ID** | `2JIE` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain A |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | Surface patches away from the active site (for stabilization) or the active site (for inhibition). |

### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `2JIE`**.
2.  **Define your Goal:** Decide if you want to inhibit or stabilize.
3.  **Select Hotspot:** Choose residues accordingly.
