## Biological Context

**Interferon Alpha/Beta Receptor 2 (IFNAR2)** is one of the two receptor subunits that recognize Type I interferons (like IFN-α and IFN-β). These cytokines are powerful antivirals and immune regulators.

**Why it matters:** Modulating this pathway is crucial for treating viral infections (activating it) or autoimmune diseases like Lupus (blocking it).

**The Goal:** Design a protein that binds to the extracellular domain of IFNAR2. Depending on the design goal, this could either compete with natural Interferon (blocking the signal) or potentially act as a synthetic agonist.

## Interactive Structure

The viewer below shows **IFNAR2 (Chain B)** in complex with **Interferon alpha-2 (Chain A)** and **IFNAR1 (Chain C)**.

## Design Mission

Create a binder that targets the **Interferon-binding interface** of IFNAR2.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | IFNAR2 (Interferon alpha/beta receptor 2) |
| **PDB ID** | `3SE3` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain B (IFNAR2) |
| **Binder to Mimic**| Chain A (IFN-alpha2) |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | Residues interacting with Chain A (approx 40-50, 70-80 regions) |

### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `3SE3`**.
2.  **Clean the structure:** Isolate Chain B (IFNAR2) as your target.
3.  **Analyze the Interface:** Load the full complex in PyMOL. Select Chain B residues that are within 5Å of Chain A to define your hotspot for **BindCraft** or **RFdiffusion**.
