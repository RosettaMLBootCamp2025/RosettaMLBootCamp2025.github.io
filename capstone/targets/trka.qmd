## Biological Context

**Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA)** is the high-affinity catalytic receptor for **Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)**.

**Why it matters:** The TrkA pathway is essential for the development and survival of neurons. However, it is also implicated in chronic pain and some cancers.

**The Goal:** Design a binder that interacts with the extracellular domain of TrkA. This could be an antagonist to treat pain (blocking NGF) or a tool to study receptor activation.

## Interactive Structure

The viewer below shows the extracellular domain of **TrkA (Chain A)** in complex with **NGF (Chain B)**.

## Design Mission

Design a protein that binds to the **NGF-binding face** of TrkA.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | TrkA Receptor |
| **PDB ID** | `1WWC` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain A (TrkA) |
| **Binder to Mimic**| Chain B (NGF) |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | The residues on Chain A that contact Chain B. |

### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `1WWC`**.
2.  **Clean the structure:** Isolate Chain A.
3.  **Interface Definition:** Use PyMOL to find residues on Chain A within 5Å of Chain B.
