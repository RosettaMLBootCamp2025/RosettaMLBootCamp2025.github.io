## Biological Context

**TEM-1 Beta-Lactamase** is an enzyme produced by bacteria that confers resistance to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. It works by breaking the antibiotic molecule apart.

**Why it matters:** This is a classic target for "Binder Design" as a means of inhibition. If you can design a protein that binds tightly to the active site or an allosteric site, you might stop the enzyme from working, making the bacteria susceptible to antibiotics again.

**The Goal:** Design a binder that inhibits TEM-1 function. This is often done by targeting the active site groove.

## Design Mission

Create a binder that targets the active site cleft of TEM-1.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | TEM-1 Beta-Lactamase |
| **PDB ID** | `1FQG` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain A |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | The active site pocket (look for where inhibitors typically bind). |

### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `1FQG`**.
2.  **Identify the Pocket:** Use tools like PyMOL to locate the concave active site.
3.  **Targeting:** When using RFdiffusion, you may want to specify "binder"contigs that fill this specific pocket.
