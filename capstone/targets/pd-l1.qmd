## Biological Context

**Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)** is a critical protein expressed on the surface of many cells, including cancer cells. Under normal conditions, it acts as a "brake" on the immune system. When PD-L1 binds to the **PD-1 receptor** on T-cells, it signals the T-cell to become inactive.

**Why it matters:** Cancer cells often hijack this mechanism by over-expressing PD-L1. This allows them to "trick" the immune system into ignoring the tumor.

**The Goal:** By designing a protein binder that sticks tightly to PD-L1, we can block it from interacting with PD-1. This releases the "brake," allowing T-cells to recognize and attack the cancer.

## Interactive Structure

Explore the native interaction between PD-L1 (the target) and PD-1 (the natural binder) below.
*   **Target (PD-L1):** The surface we want to bind to.
*   **Binder (PD-1):** The natural partner we want to compete with.

## Design Mission

Your objective is to create a **de novo protein binder** that binds to the same interface on PD-L1 that PD-1 currently occupies.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) |
| **PDB ID** | `4ZQK` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain B |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | Residues **54-66** and **113-123** (approximate binding loop area) |


### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `4ZQK`**.
2.  **Clean the structure:** Keep Chain B (PD-L1) as the target. Remove Chain A (PD-1) and any water molecules.
3.  **Define the Interface:** When running tools like **RFdiffusion** or **BindCraft**, specify the hotspot residues listed above to guide the diffusion process to the correct face of the protein.
