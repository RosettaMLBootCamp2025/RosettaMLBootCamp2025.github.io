## Biological Context

**Bet v 1** is the major allergen found in birch pollen. It is responsible for seasonal allergies in millions of people worldwide.

**Why it matters:** The allergic reaction is caused when the patient's antibodies (IgE) recognize and bind to epitopes on the surface of Bet v 1.

**The Goal:** Design a "masking" protein (similar to a neutralizing antibody) that binds tightly to the surface of Bet v 1. If your designed binder covers the IgE binding sites, it could theoretically prevent the allergic reaction.

## Interactive Structure

The viewer below shows the structure of **Bet v 1**.

## Design Mission

Create a protein that binds to a solvent-exposed patch on Bet v 1. Unlike the other targets, you aren't necessarily mimicking a natural partner—you are creating a blocker.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | Bet v 1 |
| **PDB ID** | `4A88` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain A |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | Choose a large exposed surface patch. |

### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `4A88`**.
2.  **Surface Mapping:** Since there is no single "natural ligand" to mimic, you have more freedom. Pick a surface patch that looks accessible (convex or flat surfaces are easier than deep pockets for protein-protein interactions).
3.  **Pyligner/BindCraft:** These tools are excellent for identifying bindable patches on an antigen.
