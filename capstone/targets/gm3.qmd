## Biological Context

**GM2 Activator Protein (GM2AP)** is a small glycoprotein required for the degradation of gangliosides (types of lipids) in the lysosome. You may also see it referenced in the context of GM3 pathway interactions.

**Why it matters:** Defects in this protein cause GM2 gangliosidosis (AB variant), a severe neurodegenerative storage disease.

**The Goal:** Design a binder that can stabilize this protein or mimic its interaction partners.

## Design Mission

Create a binder that interacts with the lipid-binding cavity or surface loops of GM2AP.

### Target Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Target Name** | GM2 Activator Protein |
| **PDB ID** | `1G13` |
| **Target Chain** | Chain A |
| **Interface / Hotspot** | The hydrophobic cavity or surface loops. |

### Strategy Tips

1.  **Download PDB `1G13`**.
2.  **Surface Analysis:** Identify the opening of the lipid-binding cavity. This is a challenging but interesting target for "pocket" binding.
