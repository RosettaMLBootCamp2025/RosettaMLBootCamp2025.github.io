title: "Monday: Tool Installation"
---

## Overview

Monday is dedicated to installing the essential ML-based protein design and structure prediction tools on your HPC cluster. Each module guides you through installing a specific tool, from structure predictors like LocalColabFold and ESMFold to design tools like LigandMPNN and BindCraft.

**Goal**: By the end of Monday, you should have all major tools installed and tested on your HPC cluster.

## Getting Started

Before installing individual tools, complete the **HPC Setup** module to ensure your environment is properly configured:

| # | Module | Description | Status |
|---|--------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | [Common HPC Setup](0-hpc-setup.qmd) | CUDA, Conda, containers, and environment setup | **Start Here** |

## Tool Installation Modules

| # | Tool | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | [LocalColabFold](1-localcolabfold.qmd) | Fast AlphaFold2 structure prediction | Required |
| 2 | [LigandMPNN](2-ligandmpnn.qmd) | Context-aware protein sequence design | Required |
| 3 | [RFdiffusion2](3-rfdiffusion2.qmd) | Atom-level active site scaffolding | Required |
| 4 | [ESMFold](4-esmfold.qmd) | Single-sequence structure prediction | Required |
| 5 | [OpenFold](5-openfold.qmd) | Open-source AlphaFold2 reproduction | Optional |
| 6 | [Chai-1](6-chai1.qmd) | Multi-modal biomolecular structure prediction | Required |
| 7 | [Boltz-2](7-boltz2.qmd) | Structure + binding affinity prediction | Required |
| 8 | [DiffDock-PP](8-diffdock-pp.qmd) | Protein-protein docking | Required |
| 9 | [PLACER](9-placer.qmd) | Protein-ligand conformational ensemble prediction | Required |
| 10 | [BindCraft](10-bindcraft.qmd) | End-to-end binder design pipeline | Required |
| 11 | [ESM3](11-esm3.qmd) | Multimodal protein generation | Optional |
| 12 | [RFdiffusion All Atom](12-rfdiffusion-aa.qmd) | All-atom protein design (predecessor to RFd2) | Optional |

## Tool Categories

### Structure Prediction

| Tool | Input | Output | Speed | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| LocalColabFold | Sequence + MSA | Structure | Medium | High-accuracy single proteins |
| ESMFold | Sequence only | Structure | Fast | Quick predictions, no MSA needed |
| OpenFold | Sequence + MSA | Structure | Medium | Research, custom training |
| Chai-1 | Multi-modal | Complex structures | Medium | Proteins + ligands + nucleic acids |
| Boltz-2 | Multi-modal | Structure + affinity | Medium | Drug discovery |

### Protein Design

| Tool | Input | Output | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| LigandMPNN | Backbone | Sequence | Sequence design with ligand context |
| RFdiffusion2 | Constraints | Backbone | Active site scaffolding |
| BindCraft | Target structure | Binder designs | End-to-end binder design |

### Docking

| Tool | Input | Output | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| DiffDock-PP | Two proteins | Docked complex | Protein-protein docking |
| PLACER | Protein + ligand | Ensemble poses | Protein-ligand docking |

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with HPC Setup** - Complete Module 0 before installing any tools

2. **Use separate conda environments** - Each tool should have its own environment to avoid dependency conflicts

3. **Check GPU availability** - Most tools require GPU access; make sure you can request GPU nodes on your cluster

4. **Note your paths** - Keep track of where you install each tool; you'll need these paths later

5. **Test each installation** - Don't move on until you've verified each tool works

6. **Check shared resources** - Your HPC may already have databases (AlphaFold, ColabFold) installed

## Resource Overview

Approximate requirements across all tools:

| Resource | Total Needed |
|----------|--------------|
| Disk Space | 50-100 GB (tools only), 2+ TB (with databases) |
| GPU RAM | 16-80 GB depending on task |
| CPU RAM | 32-64 GB |

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the tool's official documentation (linked in each module)
2. Search for existing GitHub issues on the tool's repository
3. [Report an issue](https://github.com/RosettaMLBootCamp2025/RosettaMLBootCamp2025.github.io/issues/new) on the bootcamp site
