## Overview

Tuesday focuses on **protein structure prediction** using state-of-the-art tools. You'll learn to visualize protein structures with PyMOL, predict structures using AlphaFold2, and compare different prediction methods (ESMFold vs AlphaFold2) to understand their strengths and trade-offs.

## Modules

| Module | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [0. PyMOL](0-pymol.qmd) | PyMOL Visualization | Learn protein structure visualization, navigation, representation, and coloring using PyMOL |
| [1. AlphaFold2](1-alphafold2.qmd) | AlphaFold2 Structure Prediction | Run ColabFold/AlphaFold2 predictions and explore how parameters affect prediction quality |
| [2. ESMFold vs. AlphaFold2](2-esmfold.qmd) | Comparing Prediction Methods | Compare ESMFold's language model approach vs AF2's MSA-based approach. Learn when to use each tool |
