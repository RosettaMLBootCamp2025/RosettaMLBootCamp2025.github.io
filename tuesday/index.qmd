## Overview

Tuesday focuses on **protein structure prediction** using state-of-the-art tools. You'll learn the theoretical foundations of protein folding, visualize structures with PyMOL, predict structures using AlphaFold2, and compare different prediction methods to understand their strengths and trade-offs.

## Modules

| Module | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [0. PyMOL and VSCode](0-pymol.qmd) | Visualization & Development Tools | Learn protein structure visualization with PyMOL and remote development with VSCode |
| [1. Structure Prediction](1-structure-prediction.qmd) | Foundational Concepts | Understand the protein folding problem, Anfinsen's hypothesis, Levinthal's paradox, and structure prediction metrics |
| [2. AlphaFold2](2-alphafold2.qmd) | AlphaFold2 & OpenFold | Deep dive into AlphaFold2's architecture, run ColabFold predictions, and interpret confidence scores |
| [3. ESMFold vs. AlphaFold2](3-esmfold.qmd) | Comparing Prediction Methods | Compare ESMFold's language model approach vs AF2's MSA-based approach. Learn when to use each tool |
