title: "0. PyMOL Visualization"
---

This activity covers the basics of protein structure visualization using PyMOL.

## Resources

- [**PyMOL Tutorial Slides (PDF)**](files/PyMOL.pdf)
- [**Aesthetic Script (Python)**](files/aesthetic.py) - Script to recreate RFdiffusion figure aesthetics.

## Instructions

1.  Download and install PyMOL (or use the version on your cluster/classroom computers).
2.  Follow the tutorial slides to learn about navigation, representation, and coloring.
3.  Use the `aesthetic.py` script to apply custom styling to your structures.

### Using the Aesthetic Script

To use the provided script in PyMOL:

1.  Download `aesthetic.py`.
2.  In PyMOL, go to **File -> Run Script...** and select the file.
3.  Or run it from the PyMOL command line:
    ```bash
    run /path/to/aesthetic.py
    ```
4.  This will load new commands `get_colors` and `get_lighting` which you can use to beautify your protein renders.
